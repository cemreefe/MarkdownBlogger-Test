# Who I'm following and why

This is my notes about people I follow on the web. This is an alternate index for people I follow 
so that I won't have to rely on Twitter to remember they exist, nor have to give them a prerequisite 
of having an rss feed to stay in my reading rotation.

Legend:
I'm tagging links in this article with pound/number sign tips. Click on these tags to highlight all tagged links (Requires JS).
<ul>
<li> <find-tag>#rss</find-tag>: an RSS feed, auto-added into my reader.</li>
<li> <find-tag>#blog</find-tag>: a person's blog </li>
<li> <find-tag>#roll</find-tag>: a person's index of blogs they read/follow </li>
<li> <find-tag>#newsletter</find-tag>: a newsletter they may be curating </li>
</ul>

All feeds tagged with #rss on this page are automatically included in this reader:

### Mitxela

Alex Tim (<- mitxela) has many interesting projects. Love that they're not limited to software but venture on hardware.

Loved their process of [creating a thermal paper polaroid](https://mitxela.com/projects/thermal_paper_polaroid). I think 
he inspired the current generation of thermal paper toy cameras (one of which I immediately bought as soon as I knew they
existed). 

Another favourite of mine from their projects is the UV Protection amulet that inspires me to build a fantasy world where 
every phenomenon actually has a scientific explanation <https://mitxela.com/projects/amulet>.

### Sarah Wang

Sarah Wang's an influencer, at least she used to be. She was on our lazy-weekend-morning routine
watchlist routine when we were having our coffees after breakfast. Hardware engineer by trade,
I think she has a good balance (or rivalry!) of a technical and creative mind, which I liken to myself
and people I like to keep myself close to.

She is apparently ditching short-form content creation and venturing into blogging. Love to see it!

She is on substack so I do expect paid content in the future.

## The -their blog seems nice so I'm giving them a go- people

### Tara Calishain

Absolutely passionate about search and organizing knowledge! She thinks very deeply about 
information retrieval. It is honestly so inspiring to me. I'm giving them a follow to 
watch their content more closely.

They are the creator of <https://rssgizmos.com/> and <https://mastogizmos.com/>. With only 2 years
of coding experience! Hell, they even have [their own client-side RSS reader](https://rssgizmos.com/rssviewer.html) 
on their RSS gizmos blog, which is something I spent quite some time on this past year!

PS. Check mine out on <https://rss-reader.dutl.uk>. In my completely unbiased opinion, its great.
