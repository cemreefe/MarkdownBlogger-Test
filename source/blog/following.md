# Who I am following and what for

This is my notes about people I follow on the web. This is an alternate index for people I follow 
so that I won't have to rely on Twitter to remember they exist, nor have to give them a prerequisite 
of having an rss feed to stay in my reading rotation.

Legend:
I'm tagging links in this article with pound/number sign tips. Click on these tags to highlight all tagged links (Requires JS).
<ul>
<li> <find-tag>#rss</find-tag>: self-explanatory, really. </li>
<li> <find-tag>#blog</find-tag>: a person's blog </li>
<li> <find-tag>#roll</find-tag>: a person's index of blogs they read/follow </li>
<li> <find-tag>#newsletter</find-tag>: a newsletter they may be curating </li>
</ul>

## Mitxela

Alex Tim (<- mitxela) has many interesting projects. Love that they're not limited to software but venture on hardware.

Loved their process of [creating a thermal paper polaroid](https://mitxela.com/projects/thermal_paper_polaroid). I think 
he inspired the current generation of thermal paper toy cameras (one of which I immediately bought as soon as I knew they
existed). 

Another favourite of mine from their projects is the UV Protection amulet that inspires me to build a fantasy world where 
every phenomenon actually has a scientific explanation <https://mitxela.com/projects/amulet>.
